# InstaGallery
Sample application to utilize Instagram Api.

This application loads images from Instagram feed with a given hashtag. Images are loaded in a gridview which loads
further images dynamically when the gridview is scrolled down. I have used SimlpeImageView library to download images directly from the url provided by the feed. Clicking on an thumbnail image starts another activity with an enlarged image. Default hashtag is set to "Spring" which can be changed using the search bar provided in the action bar above.
